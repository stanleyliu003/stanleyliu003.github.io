### Atelic: Travel Planner

[App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atelic-travel-planner/id6748835773) · [Link to 1 min demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rMd6Nu6NFQNgw9s5bNyy2o475DyK9ci5/view)

Atelic is a travel planning app that turns fragmented trip ideas into optimized, shareable itineraries with real-time feasibility checks. Our platform features a map-centric canvas with live optimization and integrated local data. It also has an itinerary generation engine, real-time collaboration, and Google/Uber/Instagram API integration. Since launching our app on October 30, 2025 we have helped 610 users create 914 trips globally. I led the initial customer disovery interviewing 300+ users, designed early mockups using Figma, built an MVP using React Native and AWS backend, launched a 3-month 80-person beta program to iterate UI/UX design based on user feedback, publically launched the product, and pitched/received $16,000 in grants from the Wharton School of Business.

### Microfluidic Device for Blood Plasma Separation and Fluorescence Detection of HIV-1 P24 Biomarkers 
[Publication](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sna.2020.112482)

Developed a handheld diagnostic device for the detection of HIV-1 P24 Biomarkers. This microfluidic device successfully demonstrated blood plasma separation, with a 31.8% yield and 99.9% plasma purity, comparable to a traditional centrifuge. The fluorescent detection of HIV-1 P24 antibodies from a whole blood control demonstrated a detection limit of 17 pg/µL. This portable chip shows a potential of highly sensitive, quantifiable, and rapid disease diagnostics.

### Wireless IoT IMU Controlled DJ Gloves 

[Demonstration](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1piwq2ZgpzOjEnAbGEd-KqYV-RUSKMKzg/view?usp=sharing)

Developed an IoT wireless IMU gloves connected to a DJ soundboard to recognize 6-axis gesture control to control volume, tempo, and pan of output speaker. Programmed using bare-meal embedded C and implemented SPI communciation, GPIO, and timers/interupts. Designed and lazar cut physical enclosure using Solid Works. Wireless communication of data was done using Zigbee protocol.

### Documentary Tahoe Rim Trail 100 Ultramarathon

[Documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV_XZTa8c1Y&ab_channel=StanleyLiu)

Ran, filmed, and produced a documentary entitled "Running 100 Miles: FAITH MOVES MOUNTAINS." The documentary documents my experience running the Tahoe Rim Trail 100, a 33-hour ultramarathon around Lake Tahoe. The race covers 100 miles, 18,000+ feet of elevation gain, and is at 8000+ feet of elevation. During the day temperatures rise as high as 97 degrees and drop to 51 degrees at night.
